# Background Task Terminator

Background Task Terminator is an operating system project designed to optimize system performance by identifying and terminating idle applications. By reducing CPU load, the tool enhances overall system resource management. It features a user-friendly pop-up notification system that alerts users about idle applications and allows them to terminate these tasks directly.

## Features
- **Idle Application Detection**: Identifies applications that have been idle for a specified duration, optimizing system resources.
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduces CPU load by terminating idle tasks, leading to enhanced system performance.
- **Pop-up Notification System**: Alerts users when applications exceed the idle threshold and provides a direct option to terminate these tasks.
- **User Control**: Empowers users to manage system resources effectively by allowing selection and termination of idle applications from the pop-up interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Languages**: C/C++, Python

## Architecture
1. **Idle Detection Module**: Monitors system applications and identifies idle tasks based on specified thresholds.
2. **Notification System**: Generates pop-up alerts when idle applications are detected.
3. **Task Termination Module**: Allows users to terminate selected idle applications directly from the pop-up interface.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Linux Operating System
- GCC Compiler for C/C++
- Python 3.x
